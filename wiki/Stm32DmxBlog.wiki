== Update 2012-07-12 ==
Today, I committed a work in progress patch to implement the protocol for talking to the DMX controller via the serial UART.

Communication will use hardware flow control to preserve the accurate timings of the DMX packets that have to be sent out.

*Please note*, in order to use the RTS/CTS flow control on the development board, 2 solder bridges must be closed to connect the lines. Please refer to the schematics to find out which ones I mean.

I have ordered an STM32-P407 development board from Olimex via eBay. The plan is to have this P407 board talk to 2 STM32-P103 boards via the UARTS, and expose an interface for controlling the 2 DMX universes via Ethernet.

It is currently undecided if I will develop a protocol for the Ethernet of the P407, or if I will use a web server to control the DMX channels.

Modified the project for development on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The openocd configurations have been changed to use the built-in scripts. I am now also using the ARM GCC from the launchpad project. [https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded] 

I swapped compilers because this compiler does not require the user to supply his email to be able to download it.

My version of the compiler was built from the sources, compiled for 64 bit machines. The project should work without issues on the prebuilt 32bit binary version, although I have not tested this.

Committed first drop of the code. The DMX 512 communication is implemented. The application runs an RGB color wheel on channels 1-3 of the DMX512 bus.

You can find the .hex file [http://users.telenet.be/rsq/stm32-dmx512-r6_debug.hex here].

I have received the boards from Olimex, and I am coding the DMX controller.

The DMX protocol is implemented, and I can send colors to my RGB dimmer and led strip:

The RGB dimmer used is one of these:

It drives a standard RGB LED strip.

I am currently working on code cleanup and documenting the build system. A commit should happen later today.

== Update 2011-12-10 ==
The project has been started on Google Code. Parts of the wiki structure have been put in place.

Work on the build system has begun.
